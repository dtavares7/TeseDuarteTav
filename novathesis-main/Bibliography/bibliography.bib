abstract={This work aims to design the central controller of a Flexible Manufacturing System and test it beyond simulation. The FMS controller is modelled through standard PN formalism tested by simulation before subsequent controller prototyping. Then, prototypes are implemented in two alternative schemes. First, by a central controller and local micro-controllers of Arduino™-type, in a master-slave configuration, communication of micro-controllers with each other materializing through asynchronous data transmission over the I2C bus. Second, by replacing local controllers by light emitting diodes (leds) and switches for 'receive' and 'send' signals respectively. The central controller was implemented in microcontroller language by direct conversion from the respective simulated and analyzed Petri Net. Execution of the developed control programs was performed and evaluation proved that the developed prototyping method is efficient, low cost and scalable in a system-commissioning context.},

The tools include a graphical editor, a state-space based model-checking subsystem and automatic code generators to deploy the controllers on the target hardware platforms. This paper presents a new Simulator tool that offers the capability to execute embedded system controllers based on IOPT models in a Web browser. To allow the test and debug of embedded system controllers, the Simulator provides options to manipulate the value of input signals, step by step execution, and continuous execution with programmed step frequency and breakpoint definition. Simulation history is recorded, continuously storing information about the entire system state, to enable playback and history navigation. History data can later be exported in spreadsheet format for analysis with external tools and waveform drawing. The tool can be accessed from http://gres.uninova.pt.",

abstract = {The concept of decomposition in computer science and engineering is considered a fundamental component of computational thinking and is prevalent in design of algorithms, software construction, hardware design, and more. We propose a simple and natural formalization of sequential decomposition, in which a task is decomposed into two sequential sub-tasks, with the first sub-task to be executed out before the second sub-task is executed. These tasks are specified by means of input/output relations. We define and study decomposition problems, which is to decide whether a given specification can be sequentially decomposed. Our main result is that decomposition itself is a difficult computational problem. More specifically, we study decomposition problems in three settings: where the input task is specified explicitly, by means of Boolean circuits, and by means of automatic relations. We show that in the first setting decomposition is NP-complete, in the second setting it is NEXPTIME-complete, and in the third setting there is evidence to suggest that it is undecidable. Our results indicate that the intuitive idea of decomposition as a system-design approach requires further investigation. In particular, we show that adding human to the loop by asking for a decomposition hint lowers the complexity of decomposition problems considerably.},

   abstract = {With an increased need for reduced power consumption, modern trends are driving supply voltages lower across many system level designs. As processor voltage levels decrease, peripheral devices still maintain higher voltage levels creating voltage level discontinuities in the system. A solution to this problem is to use a voltage translator, which converts signal voltage levels up or down to another level. They are highly applicable for use in simple GPIO applications as well as in common push-pull interfaces such as SPI, UART, JTAG, and RGMII. The information in this application report discusses industry standard interfaces, along with common end equipment applications with a focus on the AXC family of direction-controlled level translators with the lowest operating voltage in the industry (0.65 V to 3.6 V).},
